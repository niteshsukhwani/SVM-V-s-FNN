# Comparision between SVM and Neural Network
## Abstract
This study concentrated on the comparison of SVM (Support Vector Machine) and FNN (Feedforward Neural Network) on the Titanic dataset. The experiments are performed in the same condition for both models. The comparison of models is done on the basis of accuracy in train and validation set also the cross validation score.
